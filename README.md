find_the_same_file
==================

I have a lot of pictures on the disk. Sometime I copy them to different locations but I don't remember. So there will be lots of pictures with the same content.
Sometime the name of the file will be different since I have scripts to change names, but the content is the same.

I want to create a utility to find the identical files.
